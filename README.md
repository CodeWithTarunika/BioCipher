BioCipher: Decoding E. Coli Signals in DNA Sequences

## Overview
BioCipher is a web application designed to harness advanced genomics and machine learning techniques for the detection of E. Coli presence in DNA sequences. This project involves the utilization of Pandas and Scikit-learn for preprocessing the dataset and implementing a robust machine learning model.

## Features
- Genomic Analysis: The application enables users to input DNA sequences for analysis, providing insights into the likelihood of E. Coli presence.

- ML Model Integration: The core of BioCipher involves the implementation of a machine learning model, which is a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) Classifier.
- User-Friendly Interface: The Django-based website offers a seamless and intuitive interface, allowing users to effortlessly input DNA sequences and receive instant predictions.

## Usage
- Navigate to the input page on the BioCipher web application.
- Enter the DNA sequence you want to analyze in the provided input field (the DNA sequence must be of 57 genomes length)
- Click the "Submit" button to obtain instant predictions regarding the presence of E. Coli in the given sequence.
